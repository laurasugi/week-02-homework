# Readme- Week 2 Assignment

**1. Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.**

  Most of the work I did this week consisted of downloading, configuring and exploring the programs and tools we will be using for this course.
I downloaded and am using:
  - [Github desktop & Gitshell](https://desktop.github.com/) 
  - [Atom](https://atom.io/)
  - Powershell


**2. What steps did you take to complete the assignment?**

  I created my test file in the notepad app and then changed the settings to open it with atom.  Then after making additions and changes to the file, as well as adding another test file to the repo I published it to Github.

**3. Did you have any problems or issues? How did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class repo issue tracker? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?**

  I had quite a few issues, mainly with powershell and atom.  I did not post about any issues on the repo, but looking at other peoples issues on the repo issue tracker that were similar to mine, googling specific problems, and of course re-reading the instructions given on the class website were all very helpful.

**4. Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?**
  This week I learned more about powershell commands such as `ch dir`, `pwd` and `clear`.

**5. What issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle?**
  I helped a classmate who is also using windows and struggling with powershell by suggesting a few things that helped me get started.
